Hi Alexander,

My name is Avery Smith . We have yet to meet but I came across your info on the site, [founder2be.com](https://www.founder2be.com/index.php/azide0x37/).

The following quote from your profile stood out to me:

_"I am driven to use machine intelligence to enhance that of mankind in the pursuit of a healthier society and a deeper harmony with nature."_

That statement resonates with me because I have a similar desire. Our philosophies about utilizing machine intelligence to advance a healthier society may be simpatico-would you be open to a conversation?

Specifically, I am a software engineer who is recently published in Jama Dermatology, a peer-reviewed medical journal published by the American Medical Association. 

In "[Machine Learning and Health Care Disparities in Dermatology](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2688587)" Dr. Adewole S. Adamson and I highlight the racial disparities in machine learning and dermatology.

Fortunately, our publication is proving itself popular as one of the thought leaders in Med Tech thinks our article is **"important"** and [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1024672211687243776).

I want to share with you more of the vision that I have regarding this issue and am hoping you'd be open to a call at some point. If so, please email me [avery@mend.ai](mailto:avery@mend.ai), and I'll be sure to respond.

P.S.

I also sent you a friend request on LinkedIn.
